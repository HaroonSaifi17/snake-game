# Snake Game

This is a simple snake game made in Rust using the crossterm library. I built this game to learn more about Rust and game development.

## Installation

To install the game, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After installing Rust, you can clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash 
cargo run
```

## Controls 

- Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
- Press `Esc` to quit the game.
